# Automate KYC for Financial Institutions
Introduction
This repository contains a dissertation project that focuses on automating the KYC (Know Your Customer) onboarding process for financial institutions. The project combines blockchain technology with machine learning techniques to streamline and enhance the KYC process, ensuring efficiency, security, and accuracy.

## Features
### Blockchain Technology: 
  Utilizes smart contracts as the foundational technology to ensure secure and transparent transactions.
### Decentralized Database: 
  Employs IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for a decentralized and tamper-proof database, enhancing data integrity and availability.
### OCR Integration: 
  Integrates OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology provided by Microsoft Azure to automate the extraction of textual information from documents, reducing human errors and improving accuracy.
  
## How It Works
1. Smart Contracts: The project leverages smart contracts to establish secure and transparent interactions between parties involved in the KYC process. These contracts automate various stages of customer verification and approval.
2 IPFS: IPFS is used to create a decentralized and distributed database, ensuring that customer data is stored securely and is easily accessible while maintaining the integrity of the information.
3. OCR Technology: Microsoft Azure's OCR technology is integrated to automatically extract relevant information from documents provided by customers. This eliminates manual data entry, reducing the likelihood of errors and accelerating the KYC verification process.
